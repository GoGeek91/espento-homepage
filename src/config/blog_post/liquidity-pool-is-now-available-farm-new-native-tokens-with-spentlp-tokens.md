- The Espento team will first pick the core.

- Community projects will be those that have passed a community vote on the governance site.

For the time being, the LIQUIDITY tokenâ€™s key utility capabilities are governance, fee collection, stacking SPENT block rewards, and the future Liquidity lottery.
