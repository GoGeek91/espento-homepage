Impermanent loss has been a point of consideration for liquidity providers in DeFi. Espento V3 addresses this by enabling providers to focus liquidity in specific price ranges, minimizing the risk of impermanent loss. This is a marked improvement over the uniform liquidity distribution seen in V2.

> # Efficiency and Reduced Costs:

The concentrated liquidity and customizable strategies in Espento V3 contribute to heightened capital efficiency. This could potentially lead to lower fees for traders, as narrower spreads are anticipated within concentrated liquidity zones. As DeFi participants seek cost-effective solutions, V3’s design aligns perfectly.

> # Interoperability and Compatibility:

Espento V3 ensures seamless compatibility with existing protocols and tools, facilitating a smooth transition for users and developers alike. This ensures that the upgrades brought by V3 integrate seamlessly into the existing Espento DeFi ecosystem.
