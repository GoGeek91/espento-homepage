## STEP BY STEP GUIDE

> **Register for an account with a centralised trading platform**

- If you already have a crypto exchange account, you can skip this step.

- It is relatively simple to open an account with a big cryptocurrency market. We recommend Binance because it is the biggest crypto exchange with an extremely secure platform. It will also be simpler to transfer from this platform.First you will need to sign-up.

- Go to this [link](https://www.binance.com/en/register).

- Complete the KYC (Know Your Customer) procedure and add a payment option once you’ve signed up. You can either provide a credit/debit card or use a bank deposit here. To buy cryptocurrencies, you must first put fiat currencies (such as USD, EUR, or AUD) on the platform.

- If you are unsure how to proceed, please see the Binance Complete beginner Guidebook.
