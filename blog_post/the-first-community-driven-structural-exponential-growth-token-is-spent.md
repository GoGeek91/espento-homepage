> “This 100% community-driven initiative seeks to render the financial system obsolete by providing a compelling alternative with self-growth mechanisms.

The project began as a response to a straightforward question: can the power of the people build a project so powerful that it elevates an entire community to financial freedom and, as a result, renders the established financial system obsolete?

Philosophically, the solution is to raise an entire society to financial independence. Technologically, the solution was to create a project with the kind of systematic development that creates a ripple effect throughout its complete ecology, that is self-enhancing and exponential, and that demonstrates overwhelming velocity and advances with unstoppable growth.

The initiative includes built-in virtuous-circle-like technical mechanisms, among other things. Espento is a one-of-a-kind ecosystem with many income streams from which it makes a substantial amount of money. Espento is a decentralised protocol that distributes all of this revenue to token holders via its autonomous and trust less smart contract. Distributes as per holding.

When you buy $SPENT tokens and stake them, you are awarded with more $SPENT and $eUSD tokens for each block mined, increasing the value in your possession and giving you the ability to rule the project. The longer you wait, the more money you earn and power you gain.

Furthermore, the initiative seeks to comprehend its role in the larger cryptocurrency environment. It acknowledges the various important stakeholders with whom it engages, such as its community, financiers, technology partners, authorities, influencers, and the media, and attempts to maximize value for all parties involved.
