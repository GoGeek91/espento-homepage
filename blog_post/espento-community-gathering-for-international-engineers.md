**Outline**

It is reasonable to assume that the Cypherpunks Movement, which was extremely concerned with anonymity, gave birth to Bitcoin. It is sobering to consider that many of us still promote the use of a public and clearly traceable ledger when we consider the origins of Bitcoin.

Members of this meetup group have talked about the origins of Bitcoin, the importance of privacy on blockchains, and various cryptographic techniques for securing our privacy online.

The two most well-known blockchains, “BSC Smart Chain” and “BSC Beacon Chain,” which are the fastest and safest for project development and have the lowest fees, have been discussed by the group.

Community emphasis has also been placed on developing new blockchains that will have more sophisticated features than existing blockchains. The strategy for the Espento development phases has been discussed as the Espento blockchain is created according to its assigned time slot.

What are the ecosystem builders?

Ecosystem builders encourage entrepreneurship and innovation to bring about long-term change. They strive to lower obstacles for entrepreneurs.

Entrepreneurs, government officials, economic developers, grassroots community leaders, university leaders, academics, philanthropists, business executives, and the media are just a few of the backgrounds and fields of expertise of ecosystem builders. Their collaborative style, systems thinking, altruistic attitude, and dedication to inclusivity set Ecosystem Builders apart.

When individuals and resources are connected and collaborate to create fresh methods and solutions for assisting entrepreneurs, ecosystems flourish.
