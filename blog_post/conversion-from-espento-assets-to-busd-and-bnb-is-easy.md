> [Conversion and Burn event]

[Espento](http://espento.com/) assets can now easily be converted to Binance’s BUSD and BNB.

Every time the system converts Espento assets into BUSD and BNB assets, 1% of the transaction’s $ worth in SPENT tokens is burned.

Espento has introduced a “Convert” protocol, allowing users to immediately convert their Espento assets to Binance BUSD and BNB.

Typically, there are some issues with other Defi projects where the user must go through numerous time-consuming steps in order to cash the native properties of that project that he has held, earned, or received and must also pay exorbitant transaction fees. This issue prevents users from being able to convert the properties of their choice according to their schedule.

With this in mind, the Espento community constantly considers how it can provide users with the most flexibility possible. Espento has therefore developed a smart contract called Convert and effectively incorporated it into the system so that users can easily and quickly obtain the BUSD and BNB assets of their choosing from Binance. When converting crypto assets, users typically have to use any other third-party selling platform and pay fees there, which they find to be a costly process. However, using Espento’s system, users can escape extra costs and additional time required.

On the website’s UI, you can see the conversion procedure.

The expected value that will be acquired by exchanging the necessary currency is immediately calculated by this contract. The required commission for the transaction is already included in the amount. In addition, you can see the maximum trade amounts the site permits for each cryptocurrency.

It is important to emphasize that these approximations are based on actual market rates for cryptocurrencies.

Burning is a cryptographic word for removing a specific number of tokens from distribution. Reducing the quantity that is circulated is a fairly straightforward explanation. Because there is less of something in circulation, there is more rarity, which raises demand and raises worth.
