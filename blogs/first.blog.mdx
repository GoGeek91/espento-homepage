> [**Espento**](http://espento.com/) ‚Äúis a unique Defi Ecosystem!‚Äù which shares its most of the revenue portion with its members. Yeah, you can trust it.

### Editing with Markdown output

Stake SPENT, Add Liquidity, Earn SPENT.

[Espento](http://espento.com/) aspires to be the number one liquidity provider on the Binance Smart Chain and the home of fresh and creative gamified farming mechanisms.

### Why Binance Smart Chain (BSC)\*\*‚ùì

We trust in Binance‚Äôs capacity and determination to bring a fast and cheap transaction chain with all major security in the near future. starting on Ethereum would be the easiest thing to do and would most likely result in faster initial acceptance, but we enjoy a challenge and are optimistic about BSC‚Äôs future.

Faster and less expensive.

### What makes Espento different from other ‚ÄúDefi‚Äù‚ùì

In fact, we have created an ecosystem that will provide many opportunities for participants to earn huge returns with minimum input, all while playing.

Anyway, let‚Äôs get down to the specifics. It‚Äôs time to enter into a huge platform.

**Staking**

**_Stack your SPENT with Espento Stake._**

- Up to 150% of eUSD stable tokens will be distributed to STAKE holders every day. Users can claim these rewards and re-invest them.

- SPENT holders can swap SPENT for eUSD, and BUSD at the current price.

- SPENT is distributed proportionally at each block based on STAKE holdings.

- We will only record and distribute SPENT rewards to the wallet address that initiated the SPENT staking. Only the initiating address will receive the STAKE rewards.

**Farm**

We‚Äôre keeping the specifics close to our end because this is a totally new technique that no one has implemented yet, and ours won‚Äôt be ready until a few days after farming begins, but:

- It will be enjoyable.

- It will introduce a deflationary aspect to SPENT distribution via a novel reward model, giving you the possibility to earn a lot with a little.

**_Keep an eye out._** üëÄ üëÅ

**Other bits and pieces:**

- **Espento Info/Analytics** ‚Äî in the works

- **Espento DAO ‚Äî** will be started soon after the farm and stake are completely launched.

- **Lending-Borrowings**¬≠¬≠¬≠ ‚Äî Espento provides its whitelisted users with a one-of-a-kind Lending-Borrowing experience. It is a one-of-a-kind smart contract that allows users to lend and borrow in order to provide a reliable source of revenue, with lending and borrowing rates defined by the amount borrowed by users. Savings in excess of the required amount are collected from the lenders and given to the borrowers.

**What does the Espento team get?**

We think that value, therefore the right and reason for being ‚Äúpaid,‚Äù must be earned.

It is possible that the community will opt to award us (The Espento team) with SPENT tokens in the future as a thank-you for giving value to SPENT token holders, keeping our commitments, and so on.
